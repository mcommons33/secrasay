# Secrasay

Secrasay is a blockchain-based anonymous commenting platform built on Ethereum using Vyper. It allows whitelisted users to post comments by paying a fee, and it enables any user to pay a separate fee to reveal a comment's identity. Users can also opt for enhanced anonymity by paying an extra fee, ensuring that even if someone pays to reveal their identity, it remains hidden. All collected fees are forwarded directly to the owner's wallet.

## Features
